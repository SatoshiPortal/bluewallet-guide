# Electrum Server

### **On the main menu, go to the three-dot menu in the top right corner, select Network, then select Electrum Server:**

* Enabling offline mode will disconnect your wallet from the Bitcoin network. You can still receive funds, but your balance and transaction history will not update, nor would you be able to send funds.&#x20;
* Connect to your own node by entering its IP address and its Port. If you don't, your wallet will automatically connect to the Blue Wallet servers.
